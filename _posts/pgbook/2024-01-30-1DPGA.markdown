I will be participating in a workshop on Polar Euclidean Geometry in February. I'll be making a presentation on PGA by looking at the simplest examples: the 1D Cayley-Klein geometries.  I've always wanted to do this, and this occasion seems like the perfect occasion.  There will be several people there who have expressed interest in learning more:
* Immo Diener, 
* Thomas Neukirchner, 
* Oliver Conradt, and 
* Russ Arnold. 

First let's test a ganja app.

### Point of departure: cross ratio via determinants

We start by introducing the exterior algebra for the projective line \( P^1 \). Let the line be \( \myb{m} \) and let \( \myb{A} \) and \( \myb{B}\) be two points on \( \myb{m} \).

Recall the cross ratio of four points \( \myb{A,B,C,D} \) is traditionally defined as 
\[ cr(A,B;C,D) = \dfrac{(A-C)(A-D)}{(B-D)(B-C)} \] 

Yn order to establish projective geometry as independent from euclidean geometry, this formula had to be replaced since it uses euclidean measurements. A corrected version makes use of homogeneous coordinates on \( m \).  If \( A = (x_A, y_A), etc. \) then the determinants \( \begin{vmatrix} A~ B \end{vmatrix} := 
\begin{vmatrix} 
  x_A ~y_B\\
  y_A ~y_B
  \end{vmatrix}
\), etc., can be used to define the cross ratio in a projective way:

\[ cr(A,B;C,D) = \dfrac
{
  \begin{vmatrix}
  A ~ C
  \end{vmatrix}
  \begin{vmatrix}
  B ~ D
  \end{vmatrix}
}
{
  \begin{vmatrix}
  A ~ D
  \end{vmatrix}
  \begin{vmatrix}
  B ~ C
  \end{vmatrix}
}
  \]

#### Exercise
* Show that when \( y_A = y_B = y_C = y_D = 1 \), then  the two definitions of the ccross ratio agree.
* Verify that if \( M= \begin{pmatrix} a~ b \\ c ~ d \end{pmatrix} \) is a projectivity, then 
  \[
  \begin{vmatrix} M(A) ~ M(B) \end{vmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix}M \end{vmatrix}
  \begin{vmatrix}
  A ~ B
  \end{vmatrix} 
  \]
  hence the cross-ratio is indeed invariant under projectivities.

### The projectivized Grassmann algebra \( {\XRP{1}}) \)

#### The outer product \( \wedge \)

A full treatment of the exterior algebra $$ \bigwedge(\RP{n}) $$ lies outside the scope of this document.  See [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra). We focus here on the smallest non-trivial example $$n=1$$.

We use the determinant to define an binary operation $$ \wedge $$ on the points of $$m$$. The wedge product produces the Grassman or exterior algebra $$\XRP{1} $$ of the real projective line. 

- Choose a basis $$ \{ e_0, e_\infty \} $$ for $$ \RP{1} $$.
- Define  an algebra generated by the four elements $$\{1, e_0, e_\infty, 
I := e_0 \wedge e_\infty \} $$. 
- The algebra consists of 3 grades, each of which is a vector space:
1. grade-0: $$\bigwedge^0 =  \mathbb{R}$$
2. grade-1: $$\bigwedge^1$$, generated by $$\{ e_0, e_\infty \}$$, and
3. grade-2: $$\bigwedge^2$$, generated by $$I$$.

The outer product has these properties, which we will not prove:
* A 0-vector $$s$$ is a scalar and satisfies $$ sA \wedge B = A \wedge sB = s(A\wedge B)$$.
* It is anti-symmetric:  $$ A \wedge B = -B \wedge A $$ for 1-vectors $$A, B$$.
* It is linear: $$ A \wedge (B + C) = A \wedge B + A \wedge C $$.
* $$ A \wedge I = 0$$ for any 1- or 2-vector A.
* $$ A \wedge B = \begin{vmatrix} A ~ B \end{vmatrix} I $$ for 1-vectors $$A, B$$.

### Geometric algebras built upon \( {\XRP{1}}) \)

\( {\XRP{1}}) \) by itself is not a particularly useful tool.  However, we can follow the steps of [William Clifford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kingdon_Clifford) and add an inner product to the outer product to obtain a *geometric product* that models metric geometry in the line, depending on the inner product.

Again, a full treatment of the details of this process lie outside the scope of this document. We sketch it here.

An inner product on $$\RP{1}$$ is given by a symmetric 2x2 matrix $$M$$. We assume that the coordinate system $$\{e_0, e_\infty\}$$  has been chosen so that $$M$$ is diagonal. 

We begin by considering the case that $$M$$ is positive definite, that is, has the form $$\begin{pmatrix} 1~0\\0~1 \end{pmatrix}$$.  Hence, for points $$P=(x,y), Q= (x',y')$$, $$P^tMQ = xx' + yy'$$. Write $$P\cdot Q$$ for this inner product\cdot 

Note that $$P.Q + P\wedge Q$$ in an element of $$\XRP{1}$$.  This motivates the following definition:


For two 1-vectors $$P, Q$$, the geometric *product* $$PQ := P\cdot Q + P\wedge Q$$.

We denote this projective geometric algebra as $$ P(\mathbb{R_{++}}) $$ where the $$ ++ $$ indicates that the metric has two positive squares.

Here is the multiplication table for this product on the basis vectors of the Grassmann algebra:

\( \def\arraystretch{1.5}
\begin{array}{ c :  c : c : c : c }
 & \one  & e_0 &  e_\infty & \eye \\ \hline
 \one & \one & e_0 &  e_\infty & \eye \\ \hline
 e_0 & e_0 & 1  &  \eye  & e_\infty  \\ \hline
 e_\infty & e_\infty  & -\eye  &  1  & e_0  \\ \hline
 \eye & \eye  & -e_\infty  &  e_0  &   -\one
\end{array}
\)
